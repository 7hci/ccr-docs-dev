By using Cicuro and any of its related sites, applications, services, products and tools, and/or registering for a Cicuro account, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and in any of our Terms of Service to which you agree.

**What Information Does Cicuro Collect?**

The types of information we collect depend on whether you’ve registered for an account, which Cicuro product or service you’ve used, and how we came to acquire your information. This information can include: 

* Contact information such as name, address, telephone number or email address.

* Credit/Debit card information or any card information used for transactional purposes.

* Date of birth.

* Transaction information such as amount sent for money transfer, type of service (i.e. email, video visitation, etc.), offender name, offender ID and facility.

* Correspondence with customer support such as email, regular mail and conversations over the phone.

* We may collect and analyze the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer or any internet-accessible device to the internet as well as login and password information.



**How Does Cicuro Protect and Store Information?**

* We store and process your personal information on our computers, in our facilities, and in our servers, which may be located inside or outside of the US.

* We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, interception, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration.

* Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.

* We abide by all local and national laws with regard to the use of information, and expressly prohibit use of said information for any illegal or otherwise inappropriate conduct.



**What about Cookies?**

* Cookies are small files of data that we may place and which may remain on your computer or internet accessible device and allow us to recognize you when you return to the Cicuro site using the same device and browser.

* We use cookies to: recognize you; customize your experience; help ensure that your account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud; and promote trust and safety for all our services.

* We may use session cookies, which expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser.

* If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer or device warn you each time a cookie is being placed, or you can choose to disable all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you disable cookies, some content may not function properly. However, you can still use Cicuro by contacting Customer Service.

**Does Cicuro Share Information with Third Parties?**

* We may, from time to time, enlist the aid of third party suppliers to work for or on behalf of us. Any third parties are required to adhere to the same level of security and control as Cicuro.

* In order to protect you from potential fraud, we may verify the information you provide us with third parties. The verification process allows Cicuro to collect specific information about you in order to safeguard your personal information and any information related to a transaction.

* In particular, we will use credit/debit card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied and that the card has not been lost or stolen.

* Cicuro will only disclose personally identifiable information to third party service providers engaged by Cicuro, credit card processors, or banking authorities, or if we are compelled to do so by law. These third parties are not allowed to use your information for any secondary purposes.

* Cicuro may also disclose information that we in good faith believe is necessary to investigate fraud or illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Service.

**Marketing**

* We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

* We may call, text, mail or email you with helpful information, updates or promotional offers.

* We may use third party suppliers to market to you. Pixel tags and cookies may be used in digital messaging and on our website to help us measure effectiveness, site usage, and to enable us to provide more focused and subsequent marketing communications to you.

* You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time by contacting Customer Service at [support@Cicuro.com](mailto:support@jpay.com).
