**Payments Terms of Service** 

**As a condition to using Cicuro's payment services as described herein, you agree to these Payments Terms of Service ("Agreement") and any future amendments.**


**1.   NOTICE AND CONSENT.** By using Cicuro's services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Cicuro Privacy Policy, and any other documents incorporated by reference. You further agree that this Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Cicuro, and that this Agreement constitutes a writing signed by you under any applicable law or regulation. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Cicuro. We may amend this Agreement at any time. You agree to be bound by the modified terms and conditions of this Agreement upon your use of Cicuro’s services after the effective date of such changes. We last modified this Agreement on May 29, 2018. In this Agreement, "You," "User," or "Customer" means any person or entity using the Cicuro Service (as defined below).

**2.   THE CICURO SERVICE.** A User may send money (the "Payment"), to purchase the Cicuro Service ("Service") for an offender at a Cicuro-affiliated correctional institution, detention center, or like facility (a "Client"). If you are unsure of which offender's account to send a payment or which Cicuro Services are available to you, please contact Cicuro or the Client. Cicuro will not be liable for a Payment sent to the incorrect offender account. Cicuro or a Client has the authority to review, withhold or reject a Payment. You may make Payments through the following channels: (1) over the Internet or telephone using a Visa, MasterCard or Discover branded credit card or debit card (collectively "Bank Card"), (2) at a partner location using cash (i.e., MoneyGram), (3) at a Cicuro kiosk located at a Client using cash or a Bank Card, or (4) by sending a money order to Cicuro’s lockbox (collectively, the "Cicuro Service"). Not all channels may be accepted at a specific Client location. Please refer to the "FUNDS AVAILABILITY" section below for details regarding when the Payment will be available in the offender's account.

**3.   PAYMENT INFORMATION.** To facilitate Payments, you will be required to provide Cicuro with certain information to allow us, among other things: to verify your identity; to receive appropriate Bank Card authorization, if applicable; and to gather any other information a Client requires of you to send the Payment. Please refer to Cicuro's Privacy Policy regarding Cicuro's use of this information. When required by applicable law, Payments will be reported to federal, state or local authorities.

**4.   IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION.** You authorize Cicuro, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity. This may include asking you for further information, requiring you to provide your date of birth, and/or other information that will allow us to reasonably identify you. We may also require you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, or verifying your Information against third party databases or through other sources. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. Cicuro reserves the right to close, suspend, or limit access to your account and/or the Cicuro Service in the event we are unable to obtain or verify this Information.

**5.   FEES.** Other than for sending money orders, which is a free Payment option, you agree to pay Cicuro a fee for using the Cicuro Service, at the rate in effect at the time you make a Payment (the "Service Fee"). All Service Fees are non-refundable. Service Fees may vary by state and facility in which the offender resides and are available in the "Shop" section of our website at www.cicuro.com/shop. Cicuro is not responsible for any deductions made by the facility (for reasons such as restitution, child support, etc.) prior to the crediting of your Payment to the offender’s account.

**6.   FUNDS AVAILIBILITY.** Cicuro generally transmits Payments within one (1) to two (2) business days, with the exception of lockbox money order Payments, which are generally processed within ten (10) business days of receipt of the money order by Cicuro. While Cicuro will process Payments within these time frames, the facility may take additional time in posting those Payments to the offender’s account, and Cicuro has no control over, and is not responsible for any delay caused by, the facility’s processes and procedures.

**7.   MONEY ORDERS.** Where the lockbox money order Payment method is available to you, Cicuro will only accept money orders valued at $1,000.00 or less, depending on the Client. Any money order over $1,000.00 will be returned to you. Cicuro processes all money order payments at no cost to you.

All money orders must be made payable to "Cicuro Inc." A deposit slip and any accompanying information required by the Client must be filled out and submitted with every money order. Deposit slips may be found on [Cicuro's website](http://www.jpay.com/moneyorder.aspx). All deposit slips must be legible and completely filled out. Any materials sent with the money order other than the deposit slip will be discarded.

Cicuro is not responsible for money orders lost in the mail or otherwise lost in transit, or for money orders that are sent to the provided address which did not reach the intended recipient. If Cicuro receives a money order and there is a problem with the deposit, Cicuro will mail the money order and deposit slip back to the Customer’s address provided on the deposit slip.

**8.   CICURO SERVICE.** Depending on the Client, the Cicuro Service may be used by the offender to send SMS text messages or view certain media-related products (such as music, e-books, news and videos, if such products are available at the offender’s facility). The Cicuro Service is non-transferrable and unused portions of the Cicuro Service will not be refunded.

**9.   PAYMENT.** You are required to pay the Service Fees (along with the principal Payment amount) before Cicuro processes the Payment. By making a Payment with a Bank Card, you authorize Cicuro to process the Payment. When using a Bank Card, if Cicuro does not receive authorization from the card issuer, the Payment will not be processed and a hold may be placed on your Bank Card which can only be removed by the issuing bank. Each time you use the Cicuro Service, you agree that Cicuro is authorized to charge your designated Bank Card account for the principal Payment amount, the Service Fee and any other applicable fees. In the event that your transaction is reported as unauthorized and results in a chargeback, your account, as well as that of the offender who received the unauthorized funds, will be blocked from future Bank Card transactions until Cicuro is reimbursed or the issue is otherwise resolved.

**10.   OTHER CHARGES.** Cicuro is not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institution associated with your Payment. For example, some credit card issuers may treat the use of your credit card to purchase the Service as a "cash advance" rather than a purchase transaction, and may impose additional fees and interest rates for the transaction. Cicuro is not responsible for any non-sufficient funds charges, chargeback fees or other similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer or other provider.


**11.   RECURRING PAYMENT.** A recurring payment is a Payment in which you authorize Cicuro to charge your Bank Card on a regular or periodic basis ("Recurring Payment"). This authorization is to remain in full force and effect until you cancel a Recurring Payment. You may cancel a Recurring Payment at any time up to one (1) business day prior to the date the Payment is scheduled to be processed. To cancel a Recurring Payment, log into your account, access the "Send Money" tab, then access the "Recurring Payments" link and click "Delete."

**12.  REFUNDS.** You may not cancel a Payment once it has been processed. Under some circumstances, a Payment may not be completed or a Client may refuse to accept a Payment. In such cases, Cicuro will cancel the Payment transaction and refund the principal Payment amount less the Service Fee to the Customer, unless the Payment was processed incorrectly due to Cicuro’s error, in which case, Cicuro will also refund the Service Fee. Any disputes or refund requests relating to lost or misdirected payments must be submitted to Cicuro within sixty (60) days of the original transaction.

**13.  ESCHEATMENT LAWS.** Cicuro must comply with each state's unclaimed property (escheatment) laws. If, for whatever reason, Cicuro is unable to transfer your money order Payment to a Client, Cicuro will attempt to contact you to issue you a refund. If Cicuro is not able to contact you and you do not claim this Payment within the statutory time period, Cicuro may be required to escheat the Payment to your resident state. Cicuro will determine your state of residency based on the information provided by you at the time of Payment. If you do not claim the money order Payment within one (1) month after the date you made the Payment, where permitted by law, Cicuro will hold the Payment in an account and impose a $3.00 service fee per month until such time the unpaid Payment must be escheated to the state.

**14. GOVERNING LAW.** This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.

**15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

**THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.**

About Arbitration:

In the event Cicuro is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if Cicuro has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration instead of in court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses neutral arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. **Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and in court class actions are not permitted.**

Arbitration Agreement:

(a) Any dispute, claim or controversy among the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement ("Dispute") shall be finally resolved by and through binding arbitration administered by Mediation Center of Charlottesville (MCC) pursuant to its rules and procedures, provided that failure to adhere to any of the time limits set forth therein shall not be a basis for challenging the award.

You may obtain copies of the current rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by contacting MCC as follows:

MCC
Box 133
Charlottesville, VA 22902

Web site: www.mediationcville.org
Telephone (434) 977-2926

**You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Cicuro are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.** Both the foregoing agreement of the parties to arbitrate any and all Disputes, and the results, determinations, findings, judgments and/or awards rendered through any such arbitration, shall be final and binding on the parties and may be specifically enforced by legal proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators (unless the parties mutually agree to less). Each party shall select one arbitrator within thirty (30) days of commencement of the arbitration, failing which, upon request of any party, MCC shall appoint such arbitrator. The third arbitrator, who shall serve as Chairperson of the arbitral panel, shall be appointed by MCC. The arbitrators must apply the terms of this arbitration agreement, including without limitation, the waiver of class-wide arbitration set forth below.

(c) To the extent permitted by law, the place of arbitration shall be Charlottesville, Virginia.

(d) The cost of the arbitration proceeding, including, without limitation, each party's attorneys' fees and costs, shall be borne by the unsuccessful party or, at the discretion of the arbitrators, may be prorated between the parties in such proportion as the arbitrators determine to be equitable and shall be awarded as part of the award.

(e) The arbitration provisions set forth herein, and any arbitration conducted thereunder, shall be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 United States Code, to the exclusion of any state or municipal law of arbitration.

(f) RESTRICTIONS ON ARBITRATION: ALL DISPUTES, REGARDLESS OF THE DATE OF ACCRUAL OF SUCH DISPUTE, SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, AND TO CERTAIN DISCOVERY AND OTHER PROCEDURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN A LAWSUIT. YOU ARE WAIVING, AND WILL NOT HAVE, THE RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATION OR JOINDER OF INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES OR ARBITRATIONS, TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. FURTHER, YOU AND CICURO AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATORS HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO ORDER CONSOLIDATION OR CLASS ARBITRATION OR TO CONDUCT ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, AND ARE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO RESOLVE THE INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND CICURO ALONE.

(g) THE SCOPE, VALIDITY, EFFECT, AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION ARE TO BE DETERMINED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA OR VIRGINIA STATE COURT IN ALBEMARLE COUNTY AND NOT BY MCC OR ANY ARBITRATOR. IF A LAWSUIT IS FILED THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY STAYED, BY AGREEMENT OR COURT ORDER, UNTIL THE COURT CASE IS RESOLVED AND ALL APPELLATE REVIEW IS EXHAUSTED. THE COST OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER THIS SECTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, EACH PARTY'S ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS, SHALL BE BORNE BY THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY.

h) WITHOUT WAIVING THE RIGHT TO APPEAL SUCH DECISION, SHOULD ANY PORTION OF SECTION (10)(f) BE STRICKEN FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR DEEMED OTHERWISE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THIS ENTIRE SECTION 10 (OTHER THAN THIS SENTENCE) SHALL BE STRICKEN FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND INAPPLICABLE, AND ANY AND ALL DISPUTES SHALL PROCEED IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA OR VIRGINIA STATE COURT IN ALBEMARLE COUNTY AND BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE, SITTING WITHOUT A JURY, ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE COURT RULES AND PROCEDURES, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE SUIT.

**16. TIME LIMIT FOR FILING CLAIMS.** 
As a condition precedent to recovery, all claims under this Agreement must be filed in writing or electronically with Cicuro within six (6) months of your constructive knowledge that the alleged issue occurred.

Further, any demand for arbitration must be filed no later than one (1) year after your constructive knowledge that the alleged issue occurred.

Where claims are not filed or arbitration is not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims shall be deemed waived and will not be paid.

**17. INDEMNIFICATION.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Cicuro, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all third party claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your breach of these Payments Terms of Service, and (b) your use of the Service.

**18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** THE CICURO SERVICE IS PROVIDED BY CICURO INC. ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. CICURO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE CICURO SERVICE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON THIS SITE. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CICURO SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE PERSONAL AND PAYMENT INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE.

TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, CICURO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CICURO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SITE, ITS SERVICES OR E-MAIL SENT FROM CICURO ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. CICURO (AS WELL AS ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES AND STOCKHOLDERS) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SITE, ANY CREDIT CARD COMPANY'S NON-AUTHORIZATION OF A USER'S BANK CARD PAYMENT, ANY GOVERNMENT ENTITY'S NON-ACCEPTANCE OF A PAYMENT FROM A USER USING THE CICURO SERVICE, FOR DISRUPTIONS IN THE CICURO SERVICE, OR FOR ERROR, DELAY OR MIS-DELIVERY OF A PAYMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

**19. SEVERABILITY.** If any provision of this Agreement shall be ruled unenforceable, then the remainder shall be enforced to the extent permissible.

**20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be altered, supplemented, or amended by the use of any other document(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules and policies of the applicable Facility may also govern the Service.
